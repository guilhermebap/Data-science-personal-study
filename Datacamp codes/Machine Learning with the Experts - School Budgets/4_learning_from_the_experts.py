N-gram range in scikit-learn

Special functions: You'll notice a couple of new steps provided in the pipeline
in this and many of the remaining exercises. Specifically, the dim_red step
following the vectorizer step , and the scale step preceeding the clf (classification) step.

These have been added in order to account for the fact that you're using a
reduced-size sample of the full dataset in this course. To make sure the models
perform as the expert competition winner intended, we have to apply a dimensionality
reduction technique, which is what the dim_red step does, and we have to scale the
features to lie between -1 and 1, which is what the scale step does.

The dim_red step uses a scikit-learn function called SelectKBest(), applying
something called the chi-squared test to select the K "best" features. The scale
step uses a scikit-learn function called MaxAbsScaler() in order to squash the
relevant features into the interval -1 to 1.
