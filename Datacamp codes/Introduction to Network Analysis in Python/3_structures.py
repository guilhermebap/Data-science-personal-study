'''
This chapter is all about finding interesting structures within network data.
You'll learn about essential concepts such as cliques, communities, and
subgraphs, which will leverage all of the skills you acquired in Chapter 2. By
the end of this chapter, you'll be ready to apply the concepts you've learned to
a real-world case study.

'''
Identifying triangle relationships

We may be interested in triangles because they're the simplest complex clique.

One potential application of triangle-finding algorithms is to find out whether
users that have similar occupations are more likely to be in a clique with one
another.
'''
from itertools import combinations

# Define is_in_triangle()
def is_in_triangle(G, n):
    """
    Checks whether a node `n` in graph `G` is in a triangle relationship or not.

    Returns a boolean.
    """
    in_triangle = False

    # Iterate over all possible triangle relationship combinations
    for n1, n2 in combinations(G.neighbors(n), 2):

        # Check if an edge exists between n1 and n2
        if G.has_edge(n1, n2):
            in_triangle = True
            break
    return in_triangle



'''
Finding nodes involved in triangles

NetworkX provides an API for counting the number of triangles that every node is
involved in: nx.triangles(G). It returns a dictionary of nodes as the keys and
number of triangles as the values. Your job in this exercise is to modify the
function defined earlier to extract all of the nodes involved in a triangle
relationship with a given node.
'''
from itertools import combinations

# Write a function that identifies all nodes in a triangle relationship with a given node.
def nodes_in_triangle(G, n):
    """
    Returns the nodes in a graph `G` that are involved in a triangle relationship with the node `n`.
    """
    triangle_nodes = set([n])

    # Iterate over all possible triangle relationship combinations
    for n1, n2 in combinations(G.neighbors(n), 2):

        # Check if n1 and n2 have an edge between them
        if G.has_edge(n1,n2):

            # Add n1 to triangle_nodes
            triangle_nodes.add(n1)

            # Add n2 to triangle_nodes
            triangle_nodes.add(n2)

    return triangle_nodes

# Write the assertion statement
assert len(nodes_in_triangle(T, 1)) == 35




'''
Finding open triangles

Let us now move on to finding open triangles! Recall that they form the basis of
friend recommendation systems; if "A" knows "B" and "A" knows "C", then it's
probable that "B" also knows "C".
'''
from itertools import combinations

# Define node_in_open_triangle()
def node_in_open_triangle(G, n):

    # Iterate over all possible triangle relationship combinations
    for n1, n2 in combinations(G.neighbors(n), 2):

        # Check if n1 and n2 do NOT have an edge between them
        if not G.has_edge(n1, n2):

            in_open_triangle = True

            break

    return in_open_triangle

# Compute the number of open triangles in T
num_open_triangles = 0

# Iterate over all the nodes in T
for n in T.nodes():

    # Check if the current node is in an open triangle
    if node_in_open_triangle(T, n):

        # Increment num_open_triangles
        num_open_triangles += 1

print(num_open_triangles)




'''
Finding all maximal cliques of size "n"

Maximal cliques are cliques that cannot be extended by adding an adjacent edge,
and are a useful property of the graph when finding communities.
'''
# Define maximal_cliques()
def maximal_cliques(G, size):
    """
    Finds all maximal cliques in graph `G` that are of size `size`.

    for clique in nx.find_cliques(G):
        if len(clique) == size:
            mcs.append(clique)
    return mcs

# Check that there are 33 maximal cliques of size 3 in the graph T
assert len(maximal_cliques(T, 3)) == 33
